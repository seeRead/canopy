## Species characteristics to be explored
- hardiness
- spring blooms
- fall color
- mature size
- growth rate
- growth habit

## Priority areas for planting
- increasing human population
- low tree diversity
- low tree count

## Planting site factors
- higher sidewalk width
- less overhead lines
- more long green strips
- more existing trees in immediate area (as indicator of health)
