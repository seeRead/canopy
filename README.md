- tooltips
- dynamic color legend for species, values (via backbone)
- cross filter numbers / species for other current filters
- histogram for species distribution by neighborhood, guidelines for achieving benchmarks

- Overlay for areas in need of trees, areas ready for planting, intersection
- Time series view https://github.com/CartoDB/torque

## Species characteristics to be explored
- hardiness
- spring blooms
- fall color
- mature size
- growth rate
- growth habit

## Priority areas for planting
- increasing human population
- low tree diversity
- low tree count

## Planting site factors
- higher sidewalk width
- less overhead lines
- more long green strips
- more existing trees in immediate area (as indicator of health)
